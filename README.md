# Propzy
A PHP Laravel FilamentPHP saas for property owners and investors. Building in public.

## Requirements

Make sure all dependencies have been installed before moving on:

- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/)
- [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) >= 18

## Getting Started

Start by creating the project using Composer and configuring the `.env` file:

composer create-project viraljetani/propzy
cd propzy

After `.env` is configured, you can proceed to migrate & seed the database:

Once the database is seeded, you can login at `/admin` using the default admin user:

```yaml
Username: admin

```

The main user facing application will be at /app (AppPanelProvider.php)

### Build Assets

The project assets are compiled using Vite. This can be done by installing the dependencies and running the build command with NPM.

```sh
npm install
npm build
```
